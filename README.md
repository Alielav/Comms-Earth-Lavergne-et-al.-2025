# Comms-Earth-Lavergne-et-al.-2025
This repository contains the Python script to run the C3/C4 competition model and Graven et al. (2020) simple caron cycle model, analyse simulations and create the figures presented in:

Lavergne et al. (accepted) The recent decline in C4 vegetation abundance exerts little impact on atmospheric carbon isotopic composition, Communications Earth & Environment

# The script written in Python and input data are:

Script to run and plot figures 1-5: C3C4_model_simulations_analyses.py

Script to run a modified version of Graven et al. (2020) model: Graven2020_Python_three_vegetation_boxes_C3_C4_plants_L2025.py

Script to plot output from modified Graven et al. (2020) model and produce Figure 6: Plot_outputs_carbon_cycle_model_L2025_figure 6.py
