# Comms-Earth-Lavergne-et-al.-2025
This repository contains the Python script to run the C3/C4 competition model and Graven et al. (2020) simple carbon cycle model, analyse simulations and create the figures presented in:

Lavergne et al. (accepted in principle) The recent decline in C4 vegetation abundance exerts little impact on atmospheric carbon isotopic composition, Communications Earth & Environment

# The script written in Python and input data are:

Script to run the C3/C4 competition model and plot Figures 1-5: C3C4_model_simulations_analyses.py

Script to run a modified version of Graven et al. (2020) model: Graven et al. 2020 model Python version with three vegetation boxes and C3 C4 plants - L2025.py

Script to plot output from modified Graven et al. (2020) model and produce Figure 6: Plot outputs carbon cycle model L2025 - figure 6.py

Input data to run .py scripts are available at 10.5281/zenodo.17726762

Zhu for providing the AVHRR GIMMS fAPAR dataset, and the many researchers who have made their stable carbon isotope and plant C4 fraction data publicly available. We also thank David Orme for incorporating the new code into the official Python version of the P-model, Heather Graven for suggesting the use of the simple carbon cycle model and providing guidance for running it, and Joseph Ovwemuvwose for helpful discussions on crop inclusions in the analyses.

# Data availability
The data that support the findings of this study are publicly available. The CRU TS4.03 datasets are available from East Anglia University (UK) at https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/. The WATCH-WFDEI dataset is available from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (Austria) via the WATCH FTP server at ftp://rfdata:forceDATA@ftp.iiasa.ac.at. The annual percentage treecover from MEaSURES VCF5KYR v001 is available at https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/VCF/VCF5KYR.001. Urban areas and C3 and C4 crop distribution from LUHv2-2019 data are available at https://daac.ornl.gov/VEGETATION/guides/LUH2_GCB2019.html. The map of fraction of C4 plants from Still et al. (2009) is available at https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/932. The global C4 distribution map developed by Luo et al. (2024) is available at https://zenodo.org/records/10516423. The AVHRR GIMMS fAPAR data were made available by R. Myneni (data request contact: rmyneni@bu.edu). The concentrations and isotopic compositions of atmospheric CO2 are available in the Supplementary Material of Köhler et al. (2017), Graven et al. (2017) and Graven et al. (2020) papers, respectively. The soil carbon isotopic data were extracted from Dong et al. (2022) and is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6556096. The leaf carbon isotopic data are derived from Cornwell et al. (2018), the leaf gas-exchange data for C4 plants from Lin et al. (2015) and the share of C4 plants in ecosystem GPP from Paruelo et al. (1996, 1998), all available in the original papers.
